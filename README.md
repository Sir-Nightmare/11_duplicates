# 11_duplicates

This script finds duplicate files in folder and shows list of them on the screen.  
You can choose to delete them all.

You can run the script using following command: _python duplicates.py \<path_to_folder\>_

You will need **tabulate** package to run this script. It is used to pretty print the list of files.  
This package can also be very useful when you make tables in Latex (see [docs](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate/0.7.3)).
